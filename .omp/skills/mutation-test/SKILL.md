## Mutation Testing

Runs a mutation-testing analysis on a Kotlin (JVM-first) project using mutflow as the engine and OMP's 5-agent system for orchestration.

### Usage

- `project path`: Path to the Kotlin project root (default: current directory)
- `--targets`: Optional glob pattern for test classes to include (default: all `@MutFlowTest` classes)
- `--kmp`: (setup only) Use Kotlin Multiplatform project setup (mutflow targets JVM source sets only)
- `--focus`: Comma-separated list of test class patterns to include (bridges to Gradle `test` task's `includeTargets`)
- `--auto-approve`: When set, test-refactor-specialist may apply refactor changes directly without explicit approval. Zombie deletion and redundant test group removal always require explicit approval.
- `--mode quick`: Run with `maxRuns=10` mutations. Skip the refactor phase — only audit + report.
- `--mode standard`: (default) Run with `maxRuns=30` mutations. Full pipeline including refactoring suggestions.
- `--mode deep`: Run with all available mutations. Include full redundant test group details and per-mutation killer matrices in the report.

```
/mutation-test [project path] [--targets <pattern>] [--focus <patterns>] [--auto-approve] [--mode quick|standard|deep]
/mutation-test setup [project path] [--kmp]
```

### Setup subcommand

`/mutation-test setup [project path] [--kmp]` bootstraps the entire system into a new project:

1. **`.omp/` files copied**: agents, skills, `mutation-results.gradle.kts`, `mutation-results-src/` copied to `project-path/.omp/`
2. **`settings.gradle.kts`**: `pluginManagement` block added with `mavenCentral()` + `gradlePluginPortal()`
3. **`build.gradle.kts`**: mutflow plugin, JUnit 6 dependencies, `apply(from = ...)` for mutation-results added
4. **`buildSrc/` generated**: typed `MutationResults` module copied from `.omp/mutation-results-src/` with `kotlin-dsl` + `kotlinx-serialization` plugins
5. **`test-saboteur`** (via `task`) annotates business-logic classes with `@MutationTarget`, test classes with `@MutFlowTest`, and wraps existing assertions in `MutFlow.underTest { }`

### What happens (full mutation test run, standard mode by default)

1. **`test-quality-reviewer`** (orchestrator) receives the task and coordinates the pipeline
2. **`test-saboteur`** analyzes source code, adds `@MutationTarget` to business-logic classes, `@MutFlowTest` to test classes, and suppression comments to framework noise
3. **`test-executor`** agents run `./gradlew test` for each test class — mutflow's JUnit 6 extension handles the multi-run model (baseline + mutation runs) internally
4. **`test-auditor`** parses JSON results + JUnit XML, calculates mutation score, identifies zombie test candidates, detects over-mocked tests
5. **`test-refactor-specialist`** generates improved test code for flagged issues

- In `--mode quick`, step 5 is skipped — only audit + report output
- In `--mode deep`, step 4 includes full redundant test group details and per-mutation killer matrices

### Prerequisites

- Kotlin JVM project with Gradle
- Java 21+, Gradle 9.x+, Kotlin 2.4.x
- For fresh projects, use `/mutation-test setup` first

### mutflow architecture notes

Key mutflow constraints that affect orchestration:

- JVM-only — no JS/Native/Android support in v1
- Compile-once meta-mutant — all mutations injected at compile time, one active per run
- Global synchronized lock — serializes mutation runs; parallel executors block-and-wait
- Full per-test-per-mutation zombie detection — fork tracks all tests that kill each mutation (PR [#17](https://github.com/anschnapp/mutflow/pull/17) pending upstream)

For the full explanation of how mutflow's compile-once meta-mutant architecture works and why it matters for the OMP agent system, see [About mutflow's architecture](../../../docs/explanation/mutflow-architecture.md). For the 5-agent system and how each agent contributes, see [About the OMP 5-agent system](../../../docs/explanation/agent-system.md).

### Issue tracking

Decisions and issues tracked in `.scratch/mutation-testing-omp/`. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` for the tracking workflow.

### Dispatch

This skill spawns subagents via the `task` tool:

- **Setup**: `task with agent: "test-quality-reviewer", task: "Bootstrap mutation testing system into [project path] with kmp=[--kmp]"` — the orchestrator runs the bootstrap script, then invokes test-saboteur to annotate existing tests.
- **Mutation test**: `task with agent: "test-quality-reviewer", task: "Run mutation testing on [project path] with targets [targets] focus [focus] mode [quick|standard|deep] autoApprove [true|false]"` — the orchestrator dispatches the pipeline with the specified mode, focus scope, and approval gate.
